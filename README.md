# Umbrella

See notes in [this lesson](https://learn.firstdraft.com/lessons/104).

Tips:
- I converted the epoch time obtained from the weather API to coordinated universal time as follows: 

```
#change from epoch to universal time
utc_time = Time.at(current["time"]).utc
```
- UTC time can then be converted to, e.g., Chicago central time as follows:

```
#define CST time zone
cst_timezone = TZInfo::Timezone.get('America/Chicago') # 'America/Chicago' represents the Central Time Zone

#convert UTC to CST - not being used.
cst_time = cst_timezone.utc_to_local(utc_time)
```

- Here is the sample output:
